TripAdvisor Clone Website

This project is a frontend clone of the popular travel platform TripAdvisor, built using only HTML5 and CSS3. It’s designed to simulate the core layout and styling of the original site, focusing on clean UI, structured content sections, and responsive design. The goal of this project is to demonstrate HTML/CSS skills and web layout proficiency without the use of JavaScript or backend technologies.

The website includes multiple sections:

Header with logo and navigation bar

Hero section featuring top destinations and a search call-to-action

Popular Destinations with images and descriptions

Hotel Listings with star ratings and brief details

Restaurant Section to explore local food spots

Review Highlights showing sample user feedback

Footer with links, contact details, and social media icons
